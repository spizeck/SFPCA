# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping others learn and grow

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Enforcement

### Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Consequences

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please contact us at:
- Email: sfpcasaba@gmail.com
- Private message to any project maintainer

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially.

### What Happens Next

Once a report is filed, we will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
